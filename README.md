Welcome to the README for our counterfeit detection app, built using Flutter for the front-end and NodeJS for the back-end.

The app provides a solution to the problem of counterfeit items by using hedera hashgraph technology to securely store and track item ownership. Users are able to interact with the app through a multi-segmented system that includes manufacturers, brand owners, employees, customers, and sales representatives.

The app makes use of the @hashgraph/sdk package for communicating with the hedera hashgraph network. This package provides a robust set of tools for developers to interact with the network, including account management, transaction creation and submission, and querying of transaction data.

The Flutter front-end provides a user-friendly interface that allows for easy navigation and interaction with the various segments of the system. The NodeJS back-end handles the business logic of the app, processing requests from the front-end and communicating with the hedera hashgraph network.

To get started with the app, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file to install dependencies and set up the necessary environment variables. Once set up, start the NodeJS server and launch the Flutter app to begin using the system.

Thank you for considering our app as a solution to the problem of counterfeit items. We hope it provides a secure and reliable means for tracking item ownership and preventing fraud.
